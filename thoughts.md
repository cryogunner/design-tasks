GOAL
-------
To simplify the hotel booking experience by making filters, reviews, and offers easy to use and understand.

HYPOTHESIS
---------------
If we show clear offers, easy-to-read reviews, and provide simple cancellation options, users will be more confident in booking.

THOUGHT PROCESS
------------------------
 Users drop off when prices feel hidden or canceling feels risky.
Search filters should be minimal and user-friendly.
 Promo codes should be easy to find and apply before checkout.
 Reviews and photos build trust and help comparison.
A booking should never feel like a trap — easy cancellation is key.

USER RESEARCH SNAPSHOT
--------------------------------
Based on pain points from Booking.com, Goibibo, and MakeMyTrip user reviews, 
common issues:
   •  Complex filters
Hidden cancellation terms
   •  Promo codes fail at checkout
Inspired by Airbnb's clean design and user-first journey.

DESIGN CHOICES
-------------------
 Step-by-step funnel: Search → Filter → Compare → Book → Manage
Clear CTA at every step
Promo codes integrated early
Transparent pricing breakdown
